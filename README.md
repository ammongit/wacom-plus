## wacom-plus
An Wacom tablet configuration GUI for Linux. There are a few already in existence, but I found them to be quite lacking and out-of-date. This project seeks to make tablet configuration as easy as it is on Windows.

### Requirements
* Bash
* ANSI C Compiler
* GTK 3.0
* `pkg-config`
* `xf86-input-wacom`
* `libwacom`

### Compilation
Invoke `compile.sh release` in `src/`

Available under the GPL, version two or later.
